iMarc's Dotfiles
================

What is this
------------

This is iMarc's repository of dotfiles that we want to have on all of our web
servers as a baseline. The goal is to keep these light enough that the default
behavior is never worsened or further obscured than it was originally.

We have dotfiles for vim and tmux for starters.
